    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. </p>

    <p>HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:<br>
    <i>Web development</i>. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.<br>
    Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.<br> 
    <u>Web documentation</u>. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
    <p>The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a contact page would all have separate HTML files.</p>
